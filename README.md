# 3D-Object-Retrieval-Methods-Bibliography
Welcome to the 3D Object Retrieval Methods Bibliography repository. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive and organized bibliography of the state-of-the-art methods in 3D object retrieval. We categorize the methods into three main approaches: unimodal, cross-modal, and multimodal. Each category includes various methods based on specific modalities such as multi-view images, meshes, voxels, and point clouds.

## Categories

### Unimodal Retrieval Methods
Unimodal retrieval methods focus on a single modality for retrieving 3D objects. This category encompasses techniques that utilize:
- **Multi-view images**: Methods that leverage multiple 2D views of a 3D object.
- **Meshes**: Methods that use the polygonal representation of 3D objects.
- **Voxels**: Methods based on volumetric representation of 3D data.
- **Point clouds**: Methods that utilize sets of points in space to represent 3D objects.

### Cross-Modal Retrieval Methods
Cross-modal retrieval methods aim to bridge different modalities for 3D object retrieval. For example, these methods might retrieve 3D objects using 2D images as queries. This category highlights techniques that integrate information across different types of data to enhance retrieval performance.

### Multimodal Retrieval Methods
Multimodal retrieval methods combine multiple modalities simultaneously to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D object retrieval. These methods integrate data from various sources such as images, and 3D representations to provide a more comprehensive retrieval system.

## Goals
Our primary goals for this repository are to:
- Organize and document the current state-of-the-art methods in 3D object retrieval.
- Include both historical and contemporary methods to provide a broad perspective on the development of the field.
- List and describe benchmark datasets commonly used for evaluating 3D object retrieval methods.

## Benchmark Datasets
In addition to documenting retrieval methods, we provide information on benchmark datasets that are widely used in this domain. These datasets are crucial for the evaluation and comparison of different retrieval approaches.

## How to Contribute
We strongly encourage the community to provide contributions through pull requests!

Thank you for visiting our repository. We hope this resource helps researchers, students, and practitioners navigate the rich and evolving field of 3D object retrieval.
